# Jobs To Be Done

## JTBD Statements

1. When I need to understand if the community is active this week, I want a consolidated engagement snapshot so I can decide if intervention (poll, broadcast) is needed.
2. When a potentially harmful message appears, I want an automated flag with rich context so I can quickly adjudicate without platform hopping.
3. When I want to validate knowledge gaps, I want to ask the corpus of curated sources so I can guide future content or moderation focus.
4. When I need to solicit quick feedback, I want to launch a crossâ€‘platform poll so I can drive participation frictionlessly.

## Forces Diagram (Narrative)

* Push (Current Friction): Fragmented analytics, manual poll duplication.
* Pull (Desired Outcome): Unified actionable view & one-click engagement.
* Anxiety: Data privacy, vendor lock-in, cost scale.
* Habit: Native platform dashboards.

## Outcome Metrics

| Outcome | Metric | Baseline | Target |
|---------|--------|----------|--------|
| Faster flag triage | Mean flag triage time | Manual ad-hoc | < 4h |
| Higher engagement | Weekly poll participation | 0 / fragmented | 25%+ |
| Actionable insight | Time to dashboard insight | 30m manual gather | < 2m |
